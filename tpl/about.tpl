<h2>About Mark...</h2>
After 12 years of experience in the real estate industry, I founded Griffin Property Solutions to better meet the needs of owners and investors in Upstate South Carolina. This is the area where I grew up, went to college, and built my professional network. I know this region's values - in every sense of the word - and I would be honored to help you find your way through our booming real estate market.

They say that all real estate is local, and my local roots go deep. I earned my degree in Landscape Architecture from Clemson University, with a concentration in land use planning and real estate development. Working with some of the top names in the area and southeast region, I've helped to close millions of dollars in real estate deals, and I'm also one of a few professionals in the area certified to sell businesses.
