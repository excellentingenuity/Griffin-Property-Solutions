                After 12 years of practicing commercial real estate, I founded Griffin Property Solutions to better meet the needs of owners and investors in Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina. This is the area where I grew up, went to college, and built my professional network. I know this region’s values – in every sense of the word – and I would be honored to help you find your way through our booming real estate market.
            </p>
            <p class="static-content-p">
                They say that all real estate is local, and my local roots go deep. I earned my degree in Landscape Architecture from Clemson University, with a concentration in land use planning and real estate development. Working with some of the top names in the area, I’ve helped to close more than $XX million in commercial real estate deals, and I’m one of only three professionals in the Greenville area with XXX certification.
            </p>
            <p class="static-content-p">
                Better than any transplant, I understand the potential – and the pitfalls – of this fast-growing market. Local knowledge is essential, paired with deep experience and wide contacts. We bring all those things to the table, plus the highest ethics and strongest commitment to our clients.    
            </p>
            <p class="static-content-p">
                Commercial real estate is an industry based on numbers, but built on relationships. That’s why I invite you to call us today for an informal, face-to-face meeting. You never know how a handshake and a cup of coffee might change your property portfolio for good.
